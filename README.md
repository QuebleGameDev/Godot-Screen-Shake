# Godot Screen Shake
This simple project demonstrates the creation/use of a Camera Shake effect.
To activate the effect (in this project), use the SPACE key.
Feel free to clone this repo, and/or use any of this code for whatever projects you'd like!

This project was created using Godot v.4.3.stable, but should be compatible with all 4.X versions.
